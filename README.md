The flow I have learnd about so far for the optimal learning

HTML CSS (just enough to understand things and major ideas like box model and flexbox) thne move to Javascript (cover all the concepts and understand JS peoperly under the hood) then practice enough to make functional web apps. they might look ugly but product are worth using before they look good move to backend learn backend and master it give it proper time with enough frontend to go around then learn ReactJS to handle complex components and then move to NextJS as its full capacity can be used after learning full stack and now you are full stack developer and then upscale and focus on areas you like to highlight. this is a practical skill so dont get stuck on Theory rather spend time implementing things from scratch rather than just using them like make your own NGinx and bootloader. write and write and write. then also use old technology to face problems to know why new things are used like why react why package manager why moongoose why not SQL here. be a full stack developer understand the flow ideology and practice so stack is irrelevent and you dont get relied on a specific stack rather than building things which ever way or stack technology they are must to build in.

Now move to proper AI ML till now use AI APIs to do and make wrapper products etc.

write learning diaries and blogs to have deeper understanding on things and concepts which are important.
